The goal is to determine the minimum number of Gennadys required to achieve this arrangement given the counts of other names. \n\n### Difficulty Assessment:\n- **Complexity**: The problem requires understanding the constraints of arranging people with given counts and determining the minimal additional count (Gennadys) needed to satisfy the adjacency condition. It involves combinatorial reasoning and potentially the pigeonhole principle.\n- **Comparison to Examples**: It is more involved than the simple hexagon problem but less abstract than the functional equation or combinatorial sequence problems. It is similar in difficulty to the \"99 cards\" problem but likely requires less intricate reasoning.\n\n### Expected Reasoning Length:\nThe reasoning would involve:\n1. Analyzing the counts of Alexanders, Borises, and Vasily.\n2. Determining the maximum number of any single name to understand the worst-case scenario for adjacency.\n3. Calculating the minimal Gennadys required to break up the largest group(s) to satisfy the no-adjacent-same-name condition.\n4. Potentially considering edge cases or verifying the solution.\n\nGiven this, the reasoning length is likely to be moderate, similar to the \"99 cards\" problem but slightly shorter due to less abstract reasoning.\n\n\\boxed{7000}"
