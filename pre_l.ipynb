    "Okay, so I have this problem about a gathering with n couples. Each person can either rest alone or join a team, which is a chatting group. The conditions are that each couple isn't in the same team, and every other pair of individuals is in exactly one team together. I need to prove that when n is at least 4, the total number of teams k is at least 2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's think about what a team is. It's a group of people chatting together, and each team can't have both members of any couple. So, if I have a couple, say Alice and Bob, they can't be in the same team. But every other pair of individuals, meaning any two people who aren't a couple, must be in exactly one team together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this seems like a combinatorial problem, maybe related to block designs or something like that. I remember that in combinatorics, a design is a set system where certain intersection properties are satisfied. Maybe this is similar to a pairwise balanced design or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try to model this. Let's say we have 2n people, since there are n couples. Each team is a subset of these 2n people, with the condition that no team contains both members of any couple. Also, every pair of people who aren't couples must be in exactly one team together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if I think of the teams as blocks in a design, this is a specific kind of design where each block doesn't contain any couple, and every non-couple pair is in exactly one block. That sounds a bit like a Steiner system, but not exactly because in a Steiner system, every t-subset is contained in exactly one block, but here t is 2, but with the restriction that couples aren't in the same block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, so maybe it's a kind of graph? If I model the people as vertices, and the teams as hyperedges, then each hyperedge can't contain both endpoints of any couple, and every other pair of vertices is in exactly one hyperedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of graph theory. Let me consider the complete graph on 2n vertices, where each vertex represents a person. The edges of this graph can be partitioned into teams, but with the restriction that no team contains both vertices of any couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "But actually, it's not exactly partitioning the edges because teams can have more than two people. So, it's a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a team, and the hyperedges cover all the non-couple pairs exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in hypergraph terms, we have a 2n-vertex hypergraph where each hyperedge doesn't contain any couple, and every pair of vertices that isn't a couple is in exactly one hyperedge. We need to show that the number of hyperedges k is at least 2n when n is at least 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, okay. Maybe I can use some counting arguments here. Let's think about the number of pairs that need to be covered. There are C(2n, 2) total pairs, but we have to subtract the n pairs that are couples. So, the number of pairs that need to be covered by the teams is C(2n, 2) - n = (2n)(2n - 1)/2 - n = n(2n - 1) - n = 2n^2 - n - n = 2n^2 - 2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the total number of pairs that need to be covered is 2n^2 - 2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, each team can cover a certain number of these pairs. Let's say a team has size t. Then, the number of pairs it covers is C(t, 2). But since each team can't contain any couple, the maximum size of a team is n, because if you have more than n people, you might have to include both members of a couple. Wait, actually, no. If you have n people, you can have one from each couple, so that's possible. So, the maximum size of a team is n.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the size of a team can vary. However, regardless of the size, each team can cover at most C(n, 2) pairs, but actually, since each team can't have both members of any couple, the maximum number of pairs a team can cover is C(n, 2). But wait, no, that's not quite right. If a team has t people, none of whom are couples, then the number of pairs it covers is C(t, 2). So, the maximum number of pairs a team can cover is C(n, 2), but in reality, teams can be smaller.\n",

    "\n",
    "But perhaps instead of looking at the maximum, I should think about the average number of pairs per team. Let me denote k as the number of teams. Then, the total number of pairs covered is 2n^2 - 2n, as we calculated earlier. Each team contributes C(t_i, 2) pairs, where t_i is the size of team i. So, the sum over all teams of C(t_i, 2) is equal to 2n^2 - 2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we need to relate this to k. Maybe we can use some inequality here. For example, the sum of C(t_i, 2) is equal to 2n^2 - 2n. We can write this as sum_{i=1}^k [t_i(t_i - 1)/2] = 2n^2 - 2n.\n",

    "Since max t_i <= n, sum t_i^2 <= k * n^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, 8n^2 - 8n <= k * n^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by n^2, we get 8 - 8/n <= k.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we need to show that k >= 2n, which is much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this approach is not giving us the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that each team contributes at least 1 pair per person. Actually, each team that includes the person contributes (t_i - 1) pairs, which is at least 1 if t_i >= 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if t_i = 2, then it contributes 1 pair. If t_i = 3, it contributes 2 pairs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the number of teams containing the person is at least (2n - 2)/ (t_i - 1). But since t_i can vary, this is not straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, maybe use an averaging argument. The average number of pairs per team is (2n^2 - 2n)/k.\n",

    "Therefore, k >= (2n^2 - 2n)/C(n, 2) = (2n^2 - 2n)/(n(n - 1)/2) = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we need a better lower bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, perhaps consider that each team can cover at most n - 1 pairs for each person in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, think about the number of teams each person is in. Let's denote r as the number of teams each person is in. Then, for each person, the number of pairs they are involved in is 2n - 2, and each team they are in contributes (t_i - 1) pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, sum_{teams containing A} (t_i - 1) = 2n - 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if each team that includes A has size at least 2, then each such team contributes at least 1 pair. Therefore, the number of teams containing A is at least 2n - 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, that would mean that each person is in at least 2n - 2 teams, which is a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if that's the case, then the total number of participations S >= (2n - 2)*2n = 4n^2 - 4n.\n",

    "\n",
    "If a person is in two teams of size n, each contributes n - 1 pairs, so total pairs covered is 2(n - 1). But 2(n - 1) = 2n - 2, which is exactly the number of pairs needed. So, in this case, the person is in exactly 2 teams.\n",

    "\n",
    "But we need them to be in exactly one. So, this would require that for any two non-couples A and B, exactly one of the two teams contains both A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is that possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, let's consider a specific example. Let n = 2, so we have 4 people: A, B, C, D, with couples (A,B) and (C,D).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "Team 1: A, C\n",
    "\n",

    "But the pairs A-D, A-B (couple), B-C, C-D (couple) are not covered. So, this also doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, maybe with n=2, it's impossible to cover all non-couple pairs with just two teams of size 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because in n=2, we have 4 people, and the non-couple pairs are A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D. So, four pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team of size 2 can cover one pair. So, to cover four pairs, we need four teams, each of size 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in that case, each person is in two teams, which is 2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for n=2, k=4=2n.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem states n >=4, so maybe for larger n, we can do better?\n",

    "n=3, 6 people: A,B; C,D; E,F.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-couple pairs: A-C, A-D, A-E, A-F, B-C, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-E, C-F, D-E, D-F. Total of 12 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to cover these with teams of size 3, each team can cover C(3,2)=3 pairs.\n",

    "But each person is in how many teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person is in r teams, and each team they are in contributes 2 pairs (since t_i=3, t_i-1=2).\n",

    "So, for each person, sum (t_i -1) = 2r = number of non-couple pairs for that person.\n",

    "\n",
    "But each team has 3 people, so total participations is 3*4=12.\n",

    "So, it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for n=3, k=4=2n - 2, which is less than 2n=6.\n",

    "n=4, 8 people: A,B; C,D; E,F; G,H.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-couple pairs: Each person has 6 non-couple pairs, total of 8*6/2=24 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use teams of size 4, each team can cover C(4,2)=6 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 24 pairs /6 pairs per team=4 teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "But each person is in r teams, and each team they are in contributes 3 pairs (since t_i=4, t_i-1=3).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each person, sum (t_i -1)=3r=6 (since each person has 6 non-couple pairs).\n",

    "So, it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for n=4, k=4=2n - 4, which is less than 2n=8.\n",
